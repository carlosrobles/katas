This repository contains coding katas (problems) I like (from various sources such as [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com) or [Interview Cake](http://interviewcake.com)) or I've been asked to solve in school or interviews.

Each kata comes with a test suite.

I wrote a small note about code katas [here](http://thibaultcha.me/blog/code-katas.html).
